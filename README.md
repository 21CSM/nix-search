# nix-search

A better and channel-compatible `nix search` for NixOS using only stable Nix
tools.

## Why?

I cannot get Flakes to work, no one was able to help me for days, so I decided
to [fix the Nix channels issues
myself](https://github.com/diamondburned/nix-bonito).

Unstable Nix versions (2.3+) break all of `nix`'s subcommands including `nix
search`, so I decided to make a better `nix search` that works with stable Nix
versions.
